I've been wanting to play with some hardware ever since starting this program. Software is a whole lot of fun, but when you can combine it with something you physically build, it's even more fun!

During our lunch and learn today, we had a small workshop with Raspberry Pi. [Raspberry Pi] (https://www.raspberrypi.org/) is a mini single-board computer that was originally built to teach kids about computers. It's about the size of a credit card and can plug into a computer monitor, keyboard, and mouse.

You can do tons of things with them!
