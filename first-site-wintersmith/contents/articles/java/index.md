Today, we started learning Java!

<span class="more"></span>

It's quite different than JavaScript. Java is a strongly typed language and is not functional at all. It's strictly object-oriented. It's very explicit but also very verbose. I don't want to say that it is going to be easier to learn, but I can definitely see how some of the concepts that I've already learned from JavaScript will apply. Or, at the very least, I will have something to compare it to.

We learned about classes, finally! From day one in gSchool, we have heard, "JavaScript does not have classes", but now I'm learning a language that does. So, what's the big deal? Guess I'll find out. :)
